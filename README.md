# cables.compare
I really have no idea what I'm doing

This project is meant to be a public resource and referance tool for comparing different specifications of cables. I've found that there are just too many different types and varients of cables with the same connector (think of USB-C). 

I'm attemping to learn the ways of CSS, HTML, and JS so progress <ins>WILL</ins> be slow at times but a public project like this will hopefully keep my motivation up. More will be placed here soon.
